# PDF Tools

PDF Tools is a self-hosted web app with a Rust backend and Elm frontend. It
turns PDF pages into PNG or JPEG images, extracts selected pages as individual
PDFs in a ZIP, merges PDFs, converts ordered PNG or JPEG images into a PDF, and
imposes artwork onto print sheets.

This repository continues the original
[DaltonAlley/pdf-app](https://github.com/DaltonAlley/pdf-app) application, with
releases and container images published under `theupsstore7452/pdf-tools`.

The print-sheet workflow supports repeated or unique pages, simplex and duplex
layouts, automatic placement, previews, reusable presets, and print-ready
PDF exports.

Images to PDF keeps this workflow deliberately simple: each ordered PNG or JPEG
becomes one PDF page at its natural 300 DPI size. Page resizing, orientation,
fitting, and margins belong to other workflows.

## Make customer artwork into a print-ready flyer

Choose **Impose artwork**. **Finished width** and **Finished height** automatically
start at the original dimensions of the first artwork page: a 5×7-inch PDF starts
at 5×7 inches. Images use their detected physical size, with 300 DPI assumed when
needed. These fields are always editable. Replacing artwork updates the default
size until you edit it, choose a finished orientation, or apply a saved setup;
those choices are retained when artwork changes. Mixed-size artwork shares the
first page's default finished size.

- **Fit** preserves proportions and content, with white borders
  where the source and finished shapes differ.
- **Fill** preserves proportions and crops to the chosen frame.
  Drag the artwork or use the crop-position sliders to choose what remains.
  **Reset crop position** centers it again.
- **Stretch** fills the finished size by scaling width and height independently.
  It keeps the artwork but intentionally distorts its proportions. Crop controls
  apply only to Fill.
- **Scale to add bleed** enlarges the fitted artwork uniformly. The normalized
  crop position is retained relative to the bleed frame, but additional content
  can fall outside the finished cut. Review the cut boundary before downloading.
  Fill and Stretch cover the bleed frame; Fit can retain white borders. No mode
  invents missing edge content.
- **Finished orientation** changes the product between Portrait and Landscape.
  **Impression orientation** in the left setup column rotates its placement on the
  sheet: Auto, Upright, or Quarter-turn. These are separate decisions.

Use **Presets** to save an impose setup you expect to use again. The
starter **5x7 on 12x18** preset is available without being applied automatically.
Applying a preset fills the finished size, sheet, fitting, bleed, arrangement,
and printing choices without replacing the uploaded artwork or its page
quantities. Presets can be created, renamed, updated, applied, or deleted.

Artwork is a workspace-level global context exposed through the compact
**Artwork** toolbar beside the sheet preview, not a separate Setup step. **Fit**,
**Fill**, **Stretch**, and impression orientation stay available as you move
between the Size, Quantity & sheet, Arrangement, and Bleed tabs. All four tabs
are available immediately, including while settings are incomplete or a preview
is loading. Use the arrow keys, Home, or End to navigate the tabs. Open the
Artwork disclosure when you need fitting controls, crop positioning, per-artwork
overrides, or source and bleed information. On narrow screens, the toolbar stays
outside the Setup panel while **Preview** remains focused on inspecting the
sheet.

Mixed-size PDF pages and images can share one manually defined finished size.
Mixed pieces use regular slots large enough for the largest piece, with
individual cut guides, not an optimized nesting algorithm. Select artwork to
adjust its fitting or manually override its finished size independently. Duplex
pairs must have matching finished cuts, and odd source counts cannot be paired
automatically. In **Edit copy quantities**, **Apply to all** commits the entered
quantity to every page or pair and closes the dialog.

## Quick start with Docker Compose

Install Docker with the Compose plugin. Published images for Linux amd64 and
arm64 are available at [GHCR](https://github.com/theupsstore7452/pdf-tools/pkgs/container/pdf-tools).
Download `compose.release.yml` and `SHA256SUMS` from a
[GitHub release](https://github.com/theupsstore7452/pdf-tools/releases) into an empty
deployment directory, then run:

```sh
sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS
docker compose -f compose.release.yml up -d --wait
```

No source checkout is required. Private packages require a registry login;
an administrator can enable anonymous pulls by setting package visibility to
Public. The
release attachment pins that release's immutable image digest. If using the Compose file
from the repository instead, `PDF_APP_VERSION` defaults to `0.2.17` and can be set
in `.env` to select another published version.

To build locally instead, clone <https://github.com/theupsstore7452/pdf-tools>, enter
its repository root, and run:

```sh
docker compose up -d --build --wait
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. Compose waits for the app's built-in health check
before returning. The supplied deployment is available only from the Docker
host because the app has no built-in authentication.

Compose stores persistent application data in `./data` beside the Compose file
and mounts it at `/app/data` in the container. This preserves impose presets,
recent jobs, and export history when the container is replaced.
Impose uploads are staged in that mounted data directory so large artwork uses
the host volume's capacity instead of the container's smaller temporary layer.
Temporary background-job downloads do not survive a restart. Back up `./data`
with the service stopped if that information matters to you.

## Optional configuration

The defaults require no configuration. To override them, create `.env` beside
`compose.release.yml` (or `docker-compose.yml` for source builds). The
repository's `.env.example` lists the available settings:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HOST_PORT` | `3000` | Port published on the Docker host |
| `PDF_TOOLS_DATA_PATH` | `./data` | Persistent host directory mounted at `/app/data` |
| `PUID` / `PGID` | `1000` | Host IDs used to own persistent files |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` | unset | Optional limit for generic multipart operations; canonical impose intake has separate safeguards |
| `PDF_TOOLS_MAX_IMPOSE_UPLOAD_MB` | `512` | Total compressed artwork bytes accepted by one canonical impose upload |
| `PDF_TOOLS_IMPOSE_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `120` | Maximum elapsed time spent reading one canonical impose upload |
| `MAX_RENDER_PAGES` | unset | Optional page limit for render and split requests |
| `MAX_DOWNLOAD_MB` | unset | Optional generated-download size limit |
| `PDF_TOOLS_CPU_PERMITS` | up to 4 host CPUs | Shared workers for PDF and image processing |
| `PDF_TOOLS_MAX_ACTIVE_OPERATIONS` | CPU permit count | Concurrent upload and PDF operations |
| `RUST_LOG` | `info` | Server log filter |

Set `PUID` and `PGID` to the output of `id -u` and `id -g` if the deployment
account does not use ID `1000`.

When `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` is unset, generic uploads have no application-wide byte
limit. Canonical impose sources remain disk-streamed and are independently
bounded by `PDF_TOOLS_MAX_IMPOSE_UPLOAD_MB` and
`PDF_TOOLS_IMPOSE_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. Setting `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` limits
conversion, merge, split, and legacy job multipart endpoints; it does not
replace the canonical `/gang-up/sources` safeguards.

PDFium calls run on bounded blocking workers and are serialized because the
native library is process-global. Cancellation and deadlines are checked at
safe upload and page boundaries; a native call already in progress cannot be
forcibly interrupted. Preview requests are intentionally small (at most four
pages per batch), and request traces provide the source route and response
latency needed to identify repeated or slow renders without retaining another
in-memory copy of source PDFs.

## Upgrade or roll back

For released images, download the new release's Compose file and checksums,
verify them, then pull and replace the app:

```sh
sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS
docker compose -f compose.release.yml pull
docker compose -f compose.release.yml up -d --wait
```

To roll back, use the previous release's Compose file and repeat the commands.
For local source builds, update the checkout and run
`docker compose up -d --build --wait` instead.

The replacement briefly interrupts requests; the `./data:/app/data` mount
preserves persistent application data. Reload open browser tabs after the
health check succeeds. Back up data before upgrades if rollback is important.

## Publishing a release

The standalone repository runs `.github/workflows/release.yml` on `v*` tags or
manual dispatch. The tag must equal `v` plus the version in `Cargo.toml`; manual
dispatch takes the exact version without `v` and builds its existing version
tag, so a retry does not change the released source revision.
Both paths build the existing Dockerfile for Linux amd64 and arm64, publish
`ghcr.io/theupsstore7452/pdf-tools:<version>` using `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and smoke-test both
architectures by immutable image digest. Only after health and versioned frontend
asset checks pass does the workflow create a GitHub release with a digest-pinned
Compose file and `SHA256SUMS`. Images can exist even if a later smoke check fails.
An existing release is rejected before building or publishing an image.

Repository administrators must allow Actions to write contents and packages.
After the first publish, set the linked GHCR package's visibility to **Public**
in its package settings. New GHCR packages are private by default, even for a
public repository. The OCI source label links the package to this repository.

## Build from source

The source-build command above runs from the standalone repository root and
requires only Docker. For the pinned development shell and full checks, run from
that same repository root:

```sh
nix develop .#pdf-app
nu scripts/check.nu pdf-app
```

Both deployments use the same port, optional `.env`, and persistent `./data`.
Stop the source-built service with `docker compose down` before switching to the
released-image deployment on the same port.

## Local development

The PDF app uses Rust 1.97.1 and Elm 0.19.1. The npm lockfile pins the Elm
compiler, formatter, and test runner; no Rust WebAssembly target is required.
The Nix `pdf-app` shell includes Rust, Node, PDFium, Python Playwright, PyMuPDF,
Pillow, and patched Chromium and Firefox browsers:

```sh
nix develop .#pdf-app
just dev
```

Without Nix, install Rust with Clippy and rustfmt, Node, and PDFium. Set
`PDF_TOOLS_PDFIUM_PATH=/path/to/libpdfium.so` if PDFium is not on the library path.
`just dev` installs the pinned npm dependencies, generates the API codecs, builds
the frontend, starts Axum on <http://127.0.0.1:3200>, and watches frontend files.
Restart the command after backend changes. The supervisor stops only its own
processes. A directly run server defaults to loopback; set
`PDF_TOOLS_BIND_ADDRESS` for an intentional trusted-network bind. The container
uses `0.0.0.0` internally while Compose publishes to loopback.

```sh
just release       # optimized Rust backend and Elm frontend
just generate-api  # regenerate API types/codecs and Rust wire fixtures
just test          # Rust and Elm tests
just check         # formatting, lint, docs, contracts, builds, full acceptance
```

Axum serves `frontend/dist/app.html` and its versioned JavaScript/CSS assets.
Deploy the complete distribution directory together. The build generates gzip
sidecars and retains previous asset directories on incremental builds. The
frontend uses relative API URLs and works on ordinary HTTP origins without
`crypto.randomUUID`, clipboard permissions, or a secure context.

Elm owns workflow state, files, HTTP uploads, validation, polling, and stale
response rejection. The small [browser bridge](frontend/bridge.js) manages
binary preview blobs, object URLs, downloads, storage, native dialog focus, and
crop pointer events. Rust remains authoritative for production geometry. See
[frontend implementation notes](frontend/README.md) for resource lifecycles and
the audited elm-rs generation boundary. The
[migration acceptance record](elm-migration-acceptance.md) lists verified
workflows, output checks, browser coverage, and environment limits.

The acceptance scripts use Python Playwright against a real Axum server and
inspect downloaded PDFs and raster images with PyMuPDF and Pillow. Normal
workflow requests reach the backend; only explicit recovery tests inject delays
or failures. With the application running:

```sh
python3 scripts/elm-browser-acceptance.py --url http://127.0.0.1:3200
python3 scripts/elm-http-acceptance.py --port 3200
```

The full check launches an isolated release server with disposable data and runs
Chromium and Firefox coverage. Screenshots and result records are written to
`/tmp/pdf-elm-acceptance` by default. Override `PDF_TOOLS_ACCEPTANCE_OUTPUT` to
change that directory. No customer files are required.

Container packaging can be checked separately with a Docker or Podman engine:

```sh
python3 scripts/container-acceptance.py --engine docker
# Reuse an image:
python3 scripts/container-acceptance.py --engine podman --skip-build --image pdf-tools-elm:validation
```

This starts a disposable loopback-bound container, verifies compressed assets,
runs the same output-inspecting browser acceptance, and physically removes then
restores the Elm bundle to verify startup recovery. It does not replace Compose
services or mount persistent shop data.
